Pizza Menu
<br>
  I created a pizza menu for a fictional pizza restaurant. The menu consisted of a variety of     topping and size selections, and then computed the total cost based on te selections.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game
<br>
  I desigened a classic tic-tac-toe game where the user gets to go first, and then the computer follows. Whoever loses the round is first the next round. I customized it by having the classic "x" figure be represented by a picture of a dog, and the "o" figure represented by a cat. Sounds of both animals were incorporated, as well as an "applause" sound to indicate a winner.

Calculator
<br>
  A basic four function calculator, utilizing add, subtract, multiplication, and division functions. It was personalized for flair.
